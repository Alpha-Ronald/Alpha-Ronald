👋 Hi, I’m Ronald Adewoye  <Geek Dev>

Passionate about building elegant, cross-platform applications using Flutter or whatever.

I’m a mobile developer with a strong passion for building apps with Flutter. Over the years, I’ve grown from just writing code to designing systems and managing projects.

🔹 Flutter & Dart — I build reliable mobile and web apps with a focus on clean architecture and smooth performance. I’m comfortable with Bloc, Provider, and Riverpod for handling complex logic.

🔹 System Design & Architecture — I enjoy breaking big ideas into structured, scalable solutions and documenting them clearly. Gotten pretty good at it.

🔹 Project Management — Currently growing into technical leadership roles where I help plan, manage, and deliver projects successfully.
